# EASY VEGAN BROWNIE
>### A really fudgy dense brownie that rides the line between cake, cookie and fudge.


### INGREDIENTS
* 350 g dark choc 54%
* 125 ml coconut oil
* 80 ml non dairy milk
* 200 g white flour
* 125 g Demerara sugar or coconut sugar
* 1.5 flax eggs 1.5tbsp ground flax in 4.5 tbsp water
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* pinch salt
* 1 tsp baking powder

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat the oven to 160 C fan oven
2. Mix flax and water set aside to make your flax egg
3. Melt choc over bain marie
4. Into a bowl sieve the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt and mix together
5. Melt the coconut oil in a saucepan and add to the flour mix along with the soaked flax seeds, vanilla extract and the non dairy milk. Beat very well by hand or with an electric hand mixer
6. Add melted choc, beat again for 2-3 minutes
7. Add to lined pan (we used a 30 x 20cm pan lined with parchment) and smooth top
8. Bake for 30-40 mins until a skewer inserted comes out almost clean
9. Remove from the oven and leave until fully cool. By leaving it to fully cool this is when the brownie will firm up and develop its finished texture. This can often be one of the hardest parts of making a brownie but so essential is you want your brownie to firm up. Enjoy!
